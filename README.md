# Perception Bills of Materials Exercise
This repository contains all of the artifacts I have created for the "Bill of Materials" technical exercise. Below you will find a short description of each asset, as well as assumptions, techologies used, etc.

I thank you for the opportunity to show you my wares, and hope you enjoy!

## PerceptionBOMs.war 
The web app is ready to deploy to an application server. This was exported from the exact source code residing in this repo as of the last commit.

There are no server-specific configuration steps necessary. The context root of the application is the default: "PerceptionBOMs".
